BigBlueButton API Buddy
==================================================

Clean and simple interface for making API calls on a BigBlueButton server. It is intended to make a developers life easier when developing bigbluebutton integrations.


How Does it Work?
================
Open urls-bbb.html in a browser. Fill out the form, or use the populated values then click Submit. This will generate all the urls for all the possible API calls. Click the call you wish to make and the bigbluebutton server's response should be displayed within the browser.


Current Status
==============

- Works with the 0.7 API
